The cashierless store is launching, and retail will never be the same again.
As the driverless car is to the disappearance of taxi and truck drivers, computer vision and machine learning will be responsible for the disappearance of the cashier.
Walmart, Alibaba, Target — everyone will be copying AmazonGo’s tech now.
### AmazonGo is Live
AmazonGo is after a year of beta testing, went live this week in Seattle. It uses a combo of machine learning and computer vision to keep track of what shoppers are buying. Consumers can now expect this mega-7 Eleven type convenience store to be the fastest and best physical retail experience yet.

## Eliminating Friction of Checkout Lines
AmazonGo will sell sell fresh food and meal kits for shoppers on-the-go while eliminating typical hassles like checkout lines and waiting. It’s literally the grab and go experience and light-years beyond any “self-checkout” you might see.

In the history of retail, as a futurist I can say that this is a big moment. Chinese and the leading retailers will all be trying to replicate the seamless customer experience Amazon is offering with AmazonGo.

This isn’t just reinventing brick and mortar shopping, it’s the next era of consumer fulfillment in busy urban locations.

AmazonGo’s algorithms are trained, and if it took Amazon so long to perfect this tech enough to show it to the public, you know it’s going to be hard for Walmart, Target, Alibaba and others to truly encapsulate into their customer experience.

### How Fast Does Convenience Scale in the 4th Industrial Revolution?

However, as with self-driving tech once it goes live; everybody has to do it!

Cashierless convenience is a revolution, and it raises the bar in what consumers expect of physical retail.

It also changes the future of retail jobs, forever. When this technology goes live; mobile-sign in replaces the entire idea of having to “checkout”; so this changes not only how we staff stores, but it also automates the point of sale that could lead to a paperless — digital receipt era.

Amazon had announced the concept that is the AmazonGo store, with fanfare in December 2016. Thirteen months later, here we are finally!

Amazon is widely expected to transform physical retail with any number of physical location types.
